    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>This website is where I will document all of my coding projects.
        I have some exciting projects upcoming!
        I plan to create a langauge and its interpreter, snake, a platformer and a jumping game!
        You can access my github <a href="https://github.com/JBruh333">here</a>.
        Currently, the language, jumping game and the platformer are not available.
    </p>
    <h2>Snake</h2>
    <p>I used an online tutorial (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGmXxpIj6vs">here</a>) to build the base game.
    From there I added some new features such as an alert when the player loses and keeping track of the score.
I used the web storage api to store the high score of the user for the browser session.</p>
